# Datasets

- Genome-wide screening data were obtained from eight datasets (by CRISPR or RNAi), including one CRISPR (gene_effect.csv) and one RNAi (D2_combined_gene_dep_scores.csv) dataset from DepMap (https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/, 19Q1), one CRISPR dataset from Sanger (https://score.depmap.sanger.ac.uk/downloads), and five other datasets (https://github.com/jooslee/ISLE/tree/main/data).

- SL list were curated by integrating (i) predicted cancer SLs by our GPESL algorithm of this study (see Data Availability); (ii) SynLethDB v2 (https://synlethdb.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn), including both human and mouse SLs; (iii) clinically-associated SLs (https://github.com/jooslee/ISLE/tree/main/networks); (iv) golden SL pairs (https://github.com/jooslee/ISLE/tree/main/data); (v) SLs identified in liver cancer (https://www.thno.org/v11/p9038/thnov11p9038s1.pdf).
